Changelog for Text-Sass

0.6 - Better nesting, lots of haphazard debugging;
      Thanks to tests & queries from Bj√∏rn-Olav Strand

0.4 - Mixins, very rough. Already regretting not using a proper parser/grammar/tokeniser etc.

0.3 - Variables, operators, colour handling

0.2 - Simple nesting; a few more tests

0.1 - Started implementing examples from sass-lang homepage. Basic static conversion seems to work ok.
