Text-Sass - A Perl implementation of Sass http://sass-lang.com/

This is most definitely a work-in-progress. It only implements a
subset of the specification but it's being actively developed so if
there's functionality missing, drop me a line at rmp@psyphi.net and
send me a patch.

And yes, this should all really be done with a proper language tools,
i.e. grammar, parser, tokeniser etc.
